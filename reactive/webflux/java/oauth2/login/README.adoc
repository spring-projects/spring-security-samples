= OAuth 2.0 Login Sample

This guide provides instructions on setting up the sample application with OAuth 2.0 Login using an OAuth 2.0 Provider or OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider.
The sample application uses Spring Boot 2.5 and the `spring-security-oauth2-client` module which is new in Spring Security 5.0.

The following sections provide detailed steps for setting up OAuth 2.0 Login for these Providers:

* <<spring-login, Spring Authorization Server>>
* <<google-login, Google>>
* <<github-login, GitHub>>
* <<facebook-login, Facebook>>
* <<okta-login, Okta>>

[[spring-login]]
== Login with Spring Authorization Server

This section shows how to configure the sample application using Spring Authorization Server as the Authentication Provider and covers the following topics:

* <<spring-initial-setup,Initial setup>>
* <<spring-redirect-uri,Setting the redirect URI>>
* <<spring-application-config,Configure application.yml>>
* <<spring-boot-application,Boot up the application>>

[[spring-initial-setup]]
=== Initial setup

The sample application is pre-configured to work out of the box with Spring Authorization Server, which runs locally on port `9000`. See the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/tree/main/servlet/spring-boot/java/oauth2/authorization-server[authorization-server sample] to run the authorization server used in this section.

NOTE: https://github.com/spring-projects-external/spring-authorization-server[Spring Authorization Server] supports the https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect 1.0] specification.

[[spring-redirect-uri]]
=== Setting the redirect URI

The redirect URI is the path in the application that the end-user's user-agent is redirected back to after they have authenticated with Spring Authorization Server
and have granted access to the OAuth Client on the Consent page.

The default redirect URI is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/login-client`. No special setup is required to use the sample locally.

TIP: The default redirect URI template is `{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}`.
The *_registrationId_* is a unique identifier for the `ClientRegistration`.

IMPORTANT: If the application is running behind a proxy server, it is recommended to check https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#appendix-proxy-server[Proxy Server Configuration] to ensure the application is correctly configured.
Also, see the supported https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#oauth2Client-auth-code-redirect-uri[`URI` template variables] for `redirect-uri`.

[[spring-application-config]]
=== Configure application.yml

If you wish to customize the OAuth Client to work with a non-local deployment of Spring Authorization Server, you need to configure the application to use the OAuth Client for the _authentication flow_. To do so:

. Go to `application.yml` and set the following configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:	<1>
          login-client:		<2>
            provider: spring	<3>
            client-id: login-client
            client-secret: openid-connect
            client-authentication-method: client_secret_basic
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/login-client
            scope: openid,profile	<4>
            client-name: Spring
        provider:<5>
          spring:
            authorization-uri: http://localhost:9000/oauth2/authorize
            token-uri: http://localhost:9000/oauth2/token
            jwk-set-uri: http://localhost:9000/oauth2/jwks
            issuer-uri: http://localhost:9000
----
+
.OAuth Client properties
====
<1> `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration` is the base property prefix for OAuth Client properties.
<2> Following the base property prefix is the ID for the `ClientRegistration`, such as login-client.
<3> The `provider` property specifies which provider configuration is used by this `ClientRegistration`.
<4> The `openid` scope is required by Spring Authorization Server to perform https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[authentication using OpenID Connect 1.0].
<5> `spring.security.oauth2.client.provider` is the base property prefix for OAuth Provider properties.
====

. Replace the values in the `client-id` and `client-secret` property with the OAuth 2.0 credentials for your Spring Authorization Server. As well, replace `http://localhost:9000` in `authorization-uri`, `token-uri` and `jwk-set-uri` with the actual domain of your authorization server.

[[spring-boot-application]]
=== Boot up the application

Launch the Spring Boot 2.0 sample and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
You are then redirected to the default _auto-generated_ login page, which displays a link for Spring.

Click on the Spring link, and you are then redirected to the Spring Authorization Server for authentication.

After authenticating with your credentials (`user` and `password` by default), the next page presented to you is the Consent screen.
The Consent screen asks you to either allow or deny access to the OAuth Client. Select "profile" and
click *Submit Consent* to authorize the OAuth Client to access your basic profile information.

At this point, the OAuth Client retrieves your basic profile information via the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken[ID Token] and establishes an authenticated session.

NOTE: Spring Authorization Server does not currently support the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo Endpoint], which is optional in OpenID Connect 1.0. See https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-authorization-server/issues/176[#176] fo more information.

[[google-login]]
== Login with Google

This section shows how to configure the sample application using Google as the Authentication Provider and covers the following topics:

* <<google-initial-setup,Initial setup>>
* <<google-redirect-uri,Setting the redirect URI>>
* <<google-application-config,Configure application.yml>>
* <<google-boot-application,Boot up the application>>

[[google-initial-setup]]
=== Initial setup

To use Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system for login, you must set up a project in the Google API Console to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials.

NOTE: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google's OAuth 2.0 implementation] for authentication conforms to the
 https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect 1.0] specification and is https://openid.net/certification/[OpenID Certified].

Follow the instructions on the https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[OpenID Connect] page, starting in the section, "Setting up OAuth 2.0".

After completing the "Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials" instructions, you should have a new OAuth Client with credentials consisting of a Client ID and a Client Secret.

[[google-redirect-uri]]
=== Setting the redirect URI

The redirect URI is the path in the application that the end-user's user-agent is redirected back to after they have authenticated with Google
and have granted access to the OAuth Client _(created in the previous step)_ on the Consent page.

In the "Set a redirect URI" sub-section, ensure that the *Authorized redirect URIs* field is set to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/google`.

TIP: The default redirect URI template is `{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}`.
 The *_registrationId_* is a unique identifier for the `ClientRegistration`.

IMPORTANT: If the application is running behind a proxy server, it is recommended to check https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#appendix-proxy-server[Proxy Server Configuration] to ensure the application is correctly configured.
Also, see the supported https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#oauth2Client-auth-code-redirect-uri[`URI` template variables] for `redirect-uri`.

[[google-application-config]]
=== Configure application.yml

Now that you have a new OAuth Client with Google, you need to configure the application to use the OAuth Client for the _authentication flow_. To do so:

. Go to `application.yml` and set the following configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:	<1>
          google:		<2>

            client-secret: google-client-secret
----
+
.OAuth Client properties
====
<1> `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration` is the base property prefix for OAuth Client properties.
<2> Following the base property prefix is the ID for the `ClientRegistration`, such as google.
====

. Replace the values in the `client-id` and `client-secret` property with the OAuth 2.0 credentials you created earlier.

[[google-boot-application]]
=== Boot up the application

Launch the Spring Boot 2.0 sample and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
You are then redirected to the default _auto-generated_ login page, which displays a link for Google.

Click on the Google link, and you are then redirected to Google for authentication.

After authenticating with your Google account credentials, the next page presented to you is the Consent screen.
The Consent screen asks you to either allow or deny access to the OAuth Client you created earlier.
Click *Allow* to authorize the OAuth Client to access your email address and basic profile information.

At this point, the OAuth Client retrieves your email address and basic profile information
from the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo Endpoint] and establishes an authenticated session.

[[github-login]]
== Login with GitHub

This section shows how to configure the sample application using GitHub as the Authentication Provider and covers the following topics:

* <<github-register-application,Register OAuth application>>
* <<github-application-config,Configure application.yml>>
* <<github-boot-application,Boot up the application>>

[[github-register-application]]
=== Register OAuth application

To use GitHub's OAuth 2.0 authentication system for login, you must https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application].

When registering the OAuth application, ensure the *Authorization callback URL* is set to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/github`.

The Authorization callback URL (redirect URI) is the path in the application that the end-user's user-agent is redirected back to after they have authenticated with GitHub
and have granted access to the OAuth application on the _Authorize application_ page.

TIP: The default redirect URI template is `{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}`.
 The *_registrationId_* is a unique identifier for the `ClientRegistration`.
