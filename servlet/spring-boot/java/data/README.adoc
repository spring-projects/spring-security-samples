= Spring Data Sample

After running this sample like so:

.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
./gradlew :bootRun
----

Then you can query for messages using `luke/password` and `rob/password`.

Because the domain objects are secured, you will see a subset of fields with `luke`.

For example, querying `/` with `luke`, you'll see:

```json
  ...
    {
        "created": "2014-07-12T16:00:00Z",
        "id": 112,
        "summary": "Is this secure?",
        "text": "This message is for Luke",
        "to": {
            "email": "luke@example.com",
            "id": "luke",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }
  ...
```

However, with `rob`, you'll also see `firstName` and `lastName` like so:

```json
  ...
    {
        "created": "2014-07-12T04:00:00Z",
        "id": 102,
        "summary": "Is this secure?",
        "text": "This message is for Rob",
        "to": {
            "email": "rob@example.com",
            "firstName": "Rob",
            "id": "rob",
            "lastName": "Winch",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }
  ...
```
